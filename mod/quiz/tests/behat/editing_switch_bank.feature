    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > Edit" page

  Scenario: Switching to another bank shows the expected banks
    Given I open the "last" add to quiz menu
    And I follow "from question bank"
    Then I should see "Current bank: Quiz 1"
    Then I click on "Switch to another bank" "button"
    And I should see "Quiz 1"
    And I should see "Qbank 1"
    And I should see "Qbank 2"
    But I should not see "Qbank 3"

  Scenario: Searching for another shared bank shows the expected bank
    Given I open the "last" add to quiz menu
    And I follow "from question bank"
    Then I should see "Current bank: Quiz 1"
    Then I click on "Switch to another bank" "button"
    And I open the autocomplete suggestions list
    And "Qbank 3" "autocomplete_suggestions" should exist
    But "Qbank 4" "autocomplete_suggestions" should not exist
    And I click on "Qbank 3" item in the autocomplete list
    Then I should see "Current bank: Qbank 3"
    And I should see "Test questions 3"

  Scenario: Viewing question banks not in the current course show as recently accessed
    Given I am on the "qbank1" "Activity" page
    Then I am on the "qbank2" "Activity" page
    Then I am on the "qbank3" "Activity" page
    Then I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > Edit" page
    And I open the "last" add to quiz menu
