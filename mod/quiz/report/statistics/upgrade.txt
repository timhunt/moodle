This files describes API changes in /mod/quiz/report/statistics/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.0.9 ===

* The methods quiz_statistics_report::calculate_questions_stats_for_question_bank and get_all_stats_and_analysis
  (which are really private to the quiz, and not part of any API you should be using) now have a new
  optional argument $calculateifrequired.


=== 3.2 ===

* The function quiz_statistics_graph_get_new_colour() is deprecated in favour of the
  funtionality present in the new charting library.
* The function quiz_statistics_renumber_placeholders() is removed as the changes
  in MDL-31243 and MDL-27072 make this redundant.
