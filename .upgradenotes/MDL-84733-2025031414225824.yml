notes:
  mod_assign:
    - message: >-
        When the assignment activity sends notifications, it now sets more
        information in the $a object passed to the languages strings for the
        message subject and body. This is to give more flexibility to people
        using Language Customisation. The avaiable information is the same as
        the template context for the two templates in the next paragraph, but
        without the messagetext/html.

        Also, the overall structure of these messages is now rendered using
        templates mod_assign/messages/notification_html and
        mod_assign/messages/notification_html, so they can be overridden by themes.
        As a result of this, the methods format_notification_message_text and
        format_notification_message_html (which should have been private to
        mod_assign and not used anywhere else) have been removed.
      type: improved
